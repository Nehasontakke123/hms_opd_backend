## Option 4: Fix Twilio Setup (Recommended - You Already Have It)

Since you already have Twilio credentials, let's fix it:

1. **Check your Twilio Console** for active numbers
2. **Verify the recipient number** (+919359481880) in Twilio Console
3. **Use verified number** in your Twilio account as the "From" number

This is the quickest solution since everything is already configured!
